I did a "quiz" exercise while skimming through a youtubers video named "bro code", shoutout to him!
It was really just practice for me to apply what I had learned about Collections, Lists, Sets and Tuples and maybe a few other things.
I enjoyed it so much I decided it might be a good opportunity for my first public project and so I added a bunch more to it with some colorful flare.
Questions sourced from PyNative.com! - I plan on coming in and revising questions as I see fit with my own knowledge.
It is also my hope that it may even be a helpful metric for other beginners like me to test their knowledge on same basic Python problems and functions.
I hope to expand upon this much more dynamically and maybe even add other categories at a later point.
Thank you to all who checks it out and I hope you like it!
